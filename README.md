# The project

After analyzing the data, even though sales have increased
more than 75%. of customers only order one product.

So we decided to build a recommendation system, but we didn't have enough feedback to create a content-based or collaborative algorithm.

We decided to take a different approach and use an intelligent search engine and natural language to recommend similar products to consumers.

Everything was done in 2 weeks, you can try it at :
